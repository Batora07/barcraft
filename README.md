# Barcraft :tropical_drink: :beer:
Barcraft is an app that will help you craft your own cocktails and beer from what you have at home and helps you make a list of what to buy to craft the cocktail or homemade beer that you dream of.

Barcraft's purpose is also to help you track your recipes, for example if you want to do a Tiki cocktail requiring 'Falernum', but you don't have this ingredient, you can follow the recipe in Barcraft to craft it with 'Lime Cordial' and 'Ginger Syrup' (and so on) and if you don't own any of those ingredients but wants to craft them for the purpose of making your "main" recipe, Barcraft will help you keeping track of where you are in each of those ingredients crafting and also help you have a visual to know where you are in the main recipe.
